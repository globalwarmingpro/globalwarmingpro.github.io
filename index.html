<p>This is Metalelf, he is the slayer of the Lich King and the killer of the Cataclysm. This site and epic death knight is run by an 11 year old! About me: I have a passion for this game and have played since I can remember. I play lots of PVP and raids. I love mounts and collect a lot and I know I have more than 50! I have played since vanilla WOW.  Also I have a small guild called "City of Blinding Lights". I usually have a blazing ranger transmog but when I am getting new armor like conquest PVP amror I might not. Hope you enjoy, that was just a bit about myself. Please email me if there are bugs at calebjasonkilgore@gmail.com. Again, hope you enjoy my website. </p></p>

      <h3>Leveling</h3>
        <img src="https://monchew.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/levelflow.jpg">
        <p>click <a href="https://monchew.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/levelflow.jpg">HERE</a> for a bigger map to see where you should go next. First, you will be in your starting zone and you should do all the quest because it is the right content for you. Then you want to go to the next ranked land.  Now you want to do some PVP or dungeon content.  Equip that gear you got, if it is better and you will get more powerful and be able to kill things with ease.  Go to new continents and fight new things and experience new lore and content.  Now don't think when you are level capped that the game is over, you have much to go.  There will be more expansions with new content.  Remember there is a level character boost but you will not get the game experience if you use it and you won't know how to play so, do not use a boost.  </p>

      <h3>Combat</h3>
        <img src=http://masterherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/World-of-Warcraft.jpg>
        <p>First you look at your health and mana it is in the top left corner of the screen.  The green is your health and the blue is your mana.  There is also a yellow bar or a red bar depending on your class.  If your health is all the way up then you can start to fight.  You will have spells at the bottom of the screen and they will take from your blue, red, or yellow bar but if you are a red bar class auto attack will get it up.  Now read your spells and see what you get now target a mob by clicking on them.  Now cast a spell on them and it might not kill them on the first hit but it will do damage.  Then do auto attack and cast your spells to do more damage until they die.  There are also healing spells and different spells for different things.  You will get more spells and you can make more combos and do new awesome moves.  </p>

        <h3>Battle Grounds/Raids and Dungeons</h3>
        <img src=https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/blogs/lists/the%20black%20temple%20wow%20list%20main.jpg>
        <p>First, you want to get your friends and if you have no friends then click the instance finder. Next, select the dungeon or raid you want to do and it will get a group for you. Then when you get in, you will be teleported in.  I am going to cover raids and dungeons first. First, you are in a group where you will go through the obstacles together. You will not get attacked unless you go near so don't disappoint your group with "Ahhh.... they are chasing me... ahhh."  Next, there are bosses at certain points which are harder than normal mobs.  Once you kill the boss you will get armor which you can equip.  And each raid or dungeon is different so if you do not know the fight ask a teammate. They would rather explain than die. Battle grounds are PVP which means you are fighting players and they can attack you at any time, so you need to be ready at any time. Now for the battle grounds. There are three types conquest, capture the flag, arenas, and open world battle grounds. Conquest is where you have to capture the base and keep it there until you get the required amount of points then you win. Capture the flag is where you need to get the bases and capture the flag and bring it back to the base until you get the right amount of points. Now for the open world ones they are many of them and they are harder and very complex and different. So, I can't cover them all. Arenas are when you go into a pit with a few playeres and fight other players and whoever dies first loses.   </p>

        <h3>the auction house</h3>
        <img src="http://cdn.stallion-theme.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/wow-gold-guide.jpg">
<p>The auction house, it is either really good of it can be verry bad so new players that are reading this do not by any weapons or armor until you are level caped or you will just grow out of it in just a few days. but you can sell herbs so other people can make potions or sell ore so other people can make armor. but if you are level caped you can buy armor, weapons, mounts, pets, potions, bags, ect... also this is just me but I have made 70% of my gold from the auction house and I have 141,000.000 gold aprox at this time i have wrote this. </p></p>

        <h3>Character trials</h3>
        <img src=https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ba/6d/40/ba6d406742b24671dcfe9fa78bdadc1b.jpg>
        <p>For class trials they are great to see if that class is the right class you are looking for. All that you need to do is create the charicter then log in. Now they will not last forever so don't spend too much time into them. Then you will not be able to log back in again but then you will have a pretty good sense of what it is going to be like at level 100 and how the class plays. You will either have to delete the character or you can level boost him to keep him. But be warned if you level boost you will miss so much content that the game had to offer and you will be stuck at level 100. But if you delete the character then you can make a new one of what ever it is so you can find what the perfect class for you is.  </p>
