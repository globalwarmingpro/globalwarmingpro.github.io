        <p>"Global warming is the term used to describe a gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and its oceans, a change that is believed to be permanently changing the Earth’s climate. There is great debate among many people, and sometimes in the news, on whether global warming is real (some call it a hoax). But climate scientists looking at the data and facts agree the planet is warming. While many view the effects of global warming to be more substantial and more rapidly occurring than others do, the scientific consensus on climatic changes related to global warming is that the average temperature of the Earth has risen between 0.4 and 0.8 °C over the past 100 years. The increased volumes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases released by the burning of fossil fuels, land clearing, agriculture, and other human activities, are believed to be the primary sources of the global warming that has occurred over the past 50 years. Scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate carrying out global warming research have recently predicted that average global temperatures could increase between 1.4 and 5.8 °C by the year 2100. Changes resulting from global warming may include rising sea levels due to the melting of the polar ice caps, as well as an increase in occurrence and severity of storms and other severe weather events."</p>

        <p> Some things that you could do for the environment are just amazing and I will tell you what they are.
          <ul>
            <li>Reduce fossil fuel use</li>
            <li>Plant trees if you have a big backyard</li>
            <li>Then just reduce your waste</li>
            <li>And save water by even simpily doing bigger loads of laundry</li>

        <p>Summer temperatures are projected to continue rising, and a reduction of soil moisture, which bolster heat waves. Because human-induced warming is big on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise has not been, and will not be, the same all around the world or smooth across the country or over time. </p>

        <p>The Arctic Ocean is expected to become essentially ice free in summer before mid-century. But if you help we can still have ice and im not talking abought the ice in your freezer but it being natural in the world and the amazing things that come with it.</p>

        <p>The intensity, frequency and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased since the early 1980s. and with the warming temperature the rain will be stronger becuse more evaporates. </p>
